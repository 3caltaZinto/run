The film follows Larry Daley (Ben Stiller), a divorced father who takes a job as a night guard at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He soon learns that the museum exhibits come to life every night due to an ancient Egyptian tablet. He befriends some of the exhibits, such as Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams), a miniature cowboy named Jedediah (Owen Wilson), and a Roman soldier named Octavius (Steve Coogan). He also has to deal with some of the hostile exhibits, such as a T-rex skeleton, a group of Huns led by Attila (Patrick Gallagher), and a mischievous monkey named Dexter.
 
Larry's main goal is to protect the tablet from being stolen by three former night guards, Cecil (Dick Van Dyke), Gus (Mickey Rooney), and Reginald (Bill Cobbs), who want to use its power to restore their youth. He also has to impress his son Nick (Jake Cherry) and his love interest Rebecca (Carla Gugino), who works as a museum docent. Along the way, he learns about history, friendship, and courage.
