# What is the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac and Why You Need It
  
If you are interested in astronomy, navigation, surveying, or space science, you may have come across a publication called The Astronomical Almanac.

But how is this information calculated and what are the underlying principles and models behind it? That's where the Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac comes in. This is a companion book that offers detailed explanations and descriptions of the computational methods and algorithms used to produce The Astronomical Almanac. It also covers the theoretical and observational foundations of modern positional astronomy, such as the celestial and terrestrial reference frames, orbital ephemerides, precession, nutation, Earth rotation, and coordinate transformations.
