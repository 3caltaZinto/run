# How to Use Hasp Emulator on Windows 10
 
If you have a software that requires a Hasp dongle to run, you might be wondering how to use it on Windows 10. Hasp dongles are hardware keys that protect software from piracy and unauthorized use. However, they can also cause problems if they are lost, damaged, or incompatible with your operating system.

Fortunately, there is a solution: Hasp emulator. Hasp emulator is a software that mimics the function of a Hasp dongle, allowing you to run your software without the physical key. Hasp emulator can also help you avoid issues with Windows 10 updates that might disable your dongle or prevent it from being recognized.
 
## How to Install Hasp Emulator on Windows 10
 
Before you install Hasp emulator on Windows 10, you need to make sure you have the following:
 
- The latest Hasp drivers for Windows 10. You can download them from [here](https://support.utex.com/webapps/utexsupport.nsf/wPages/DSEO-AC4RXK2451?Open). Follow the instructions to install them on your computer.
- The dump file of your Hasp dongle. This is a file that contains the information of your dongle, such as its ID, passwords, and memory. You can create a dump file using a command line tool called [HASP/HASP4/HASP HL/HARDLOCK API Monitor](https://www.brstudio.com/wf/dongles/aladdin-hasp4-hasp-hl-emulator/). Follow the instructions to run the tool and save the dump file.
- The Hasp emulator software. There are different types of Hasp emulators available online, but some of them might be illegal or unsafe. One of the most reliable and trusted Hasp emulators is [Brain Studio's Aladdin HASP / HASP4 / HASP HL Dongle Emulator](https://www.brstudio.com/wf/dongles/aladdin-hasp4-hasp-hl-emulator/). You can request an emulator from their website by uploading your dump file and providing some details about your software and dongle.

Once you have these three components, you can install Hasp emulator on Windows 10 by following these steps:

1. Run the Hasp emulator software that you received from Brain Studio. It will ask you to select your dump file and choose a destination folder for the installation.
2. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You might need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
3. Run your software that requires a Hasp dongle. It should recognize the emulator as a valid dongle and allow you to use it without any problems.
